This is a step-by-step guide on setting up a raspberry pi(also with the ssh method).
We will also cover performing inferencing on the raspberrypi, with and without the coral tpu.

## Setup for raspberry pi
Steps taken to set up the raspberrypi OS.
### Installation of the pi imager and OS writing
* The pi imager should be installed on your PC.
* The pi imager can be gotten from [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
* You can follow this installation [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntaXWS8Lk34).
* For the next step, you would need an SD card reader and SD card of at least 16GB, make sure the card reader is not in a locked state.
* Other operating system images can be downloaded from [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/). The image used for this project was the "Raspberry Pi OS with desktop and recommended software".
